## Future Enhancements ðŸš€

### 1. Multiple Projectiles Per Turret

**Current State:** One projectile per turret slot  
**Proposed:** Allow turrets to equip multiple projectiles with switching mechanics

#### Implementation Ideas:

**Option A: Ammo System**
```csharp
public class TurretAmmoSystem
{
    public List<ProjectileLoadout> loadouts;
    public int currentLoadoutIndex;
    
    // Cycle through projectile types
    public void SwitchProjectile() { /* ... */ }
}

[Serializable]
public class ProjectileLoadout
{
    public string projectileId;
    public int ammoCount; // -1 for infinite
}
```

**Option B: Type-Based Auto-Selection**
```csharp
// Turret automatically selects best projectile for enemy type
public string SelectProjectileForEnemy(Enemy enemy)
{
    // Logic: explosive for groups, piercing for armor, etc.
}
```

**Option C: Player Toggle**
```
- Hotkey to switch between equipped projectiles
- UI indicator showing active projectile
- Cool-down on switching to prevent abuse
```

**Considerations:**
- UI complexity increases
- Balance: ensure no "always best" combination
- Performance: multiple projectile tracking per turret
- Player skill: reward strategic switching

---

### 2. Enhanced Trait Upgrades

**Current:** Base stats increase per level  
**Proposed:** Trait-specific upgrades

#### Examples:

**Explosive Trait:**
- Level 1: 2.0 radius
- Level 5: 3.0 radius, +20% explosion damage

**Piercing Trait:**
- Level 1: 3 sec duration, 1 tick/sec
- Level 5: 5 sec duration, 2 ticks/sec

**Chain Trait:**
- Level 1: 3 targets, 20% falloff
- Level 5: 5 targets, 10% falloff

#### Implementation:
```csharp
// Add to ProjectileDefinition
[Header("Trait Upgrades")]
public float explosionRadiusPerLevel = 0.2f;
public float piercingDurationPerLevel = 0.4f;
public int chainTargetsPerLevel = 0; // +1 every 2 levels

// Calculation methods
public float GetExplosionRadiusAtLevel(int level) { /* ... */ }
```

---

### 3. Projectile Mastery/Prestige System

**Concept:** After maxing a projectile, unlock additional benefits

#### Features:
- **Mastery Levels:** Beyond max upgrade level
- **Mastery Bonuses:** Unique perks (e.g., "Explosive chain" for Explosive projectiles)
- **Prestige Currency:** Special currency earned from using maxed projectiles
- **Cosmetic Upgrades:** Visual flair for mastered projectiles

#### Example:
```
Explosive Bolt - Mastery 3
â”œâ”€â”€ Bonus: 10% chance to double explosion radius
â”œâ”€â”€ Cost: 500 Mastery Points
â””â”€â”€ Requirement: 1000 kills with Explosive Bolt
```

---

### 4. Turret-Projectile Synergies

**Concept:** Certain turret + projectile combos grant bonuses

#### Examples:

**Synergy: Rapid Turret + Piercing Shard**
- Bonus: +20% tick rate on piercing effect
- Theme: Fast turret applies more DoT ticks

**Synergy: Heavy Turret + Explosive Bolt**
- Bonus: +30% explosion radius
- Theme: Slow, powerful turret enhances AoE

**Synergy: Sniper Turret + Homing Missile**
- Bonus: +50% homing turn rate
- Theme: Precision turret improves tracking

#### Implementation:
```csharp
// In TurretDefinition
public List<ProjectileSynergy> synergies;

[Serializable]
public class ProjectileSynergy
{
    public string projectileId;
    public SynergyBonus bonus;
}
```

---

### 5. Tower Base Integration

**Current:** Tower bases exist but limited integration with projectiles  
**Proposed:** Tower bases modify projectile behavior

#### Examples:

**Tower Base: "Core Reactor"**
- Effect: All projectiles gain +15% damage
- Theme: Power boost

**Tower Base: "Velocity Enhancer"**
- Effect: All projectiles gain +25% speed
- Theme: Rate of fire / projectile speed

**Tower Base: "Overcharge Platform"**
- Effect: 5% chance for projectiles to trigger twice
- Theme: RNG power spike

**Tower Base: "Amplifier Array"**
- Effect: Trait effects are 20% stronger (larger explosions, longer DoT, etc.)
- Theme: Enhancement focus

#### Implementation:
```csharp
// Add to TowerBaseData
public List<ProjectileModifier> projectileModifiers;

public class ProjectileModifier
{
    public ModifierType type; // Damage, Speed, TraitPower
    public float multiplier;
}
```

---

### 6. Projectile Crafting System

**Concept:** Combine projectile traits to create custom projectiles

#### Features:
- **Trait Fusion:** Combine two projectiles to merge traits
- **Trait Extraction:** Remove a trait from a projectile
- **Stat Tuning:** Adjust damage/speed balance
- **Rarity System:** Crafted projectiles have quality tiers

#### Example Crafting Recipe:
```
Explosive Bolt + Piercing Shard
â”œâ”€â”€ Result: Explosive Shard
â”œâ”€â”€ Traits: Explosive + Piercing + Penetrate
â”œâ”€â”€ Stats: Average of both parents
â””â”€â”€ Cost: 1000 Cores + both projectiles sacrificed (optional)
```

#### Balancing:
- Limit number of traits (max 3?)
- Crafted projectiles more expensive to upgrade
- Unique traits can't be crafted (only found/unlocked)

---

### 7. Conditional Projectile Effects

**Concept:** Traits that trigger under specific conditions

#### New Trait Ideas:

**Conditional Explosive:**
- Only explodes if kills the target
- Higher explosion damage as trade-off

**Adaptive Damage:**
- Increases damage vs high HP enemies
- Decreases damage vs low HP enemies

**Ricochet:**
- Bounces off terrain/borders
- Loses damage per bounce

**Split:**
- On hit, splits into 2-3 smaller projectiles
- Smaller projectiles deal reduced damage

#### Implementation:
```csharp
// New traits
public enum ProjectileTrait
{
    // ... existing traits ...
    Ricochet      = 1 << 8,
    Split         = 1 << 9,
    Conditional   = 1 << 10,
}

// In Bullet.cs
private void ApplyConditionalEffects(Enemy enemy) { /* ... */ }
```

---

### 8. Dynamic Difficulty Scaling

**Concept:** Projectile effectiveness scales with difficulty

#### Features:
- Higher difficulties have stronger enemies
- Projectiles maintain relevance through scaling
- Encourages upgrades at higher difficulties

#### Example:
```
Difficulty 1: Standard Bullet does 100% damage
Difficulty 5: Standard Bullet does 80% damage (enemy armor)
Solution: Upgrade or switch to armor-piercing projectiles
```

---

### 9. Projectile Objectives & Achievements

**Status:** âœ… **Implemented in Achievement System**

**Concept:** Unlock bonuses by completing projectile-specific challenges

The achievement system now supports projectile-specific achievements with the following features:

#### Implementation:
- **AchievementType.ShootProjectiles:** Track total projectiles fired
- **AchievementType.UnlockProjectile:** Track projectile unlocks
- **AchievementType.UpgradeProjectile:** Track projectile upgrades
- **Filters:** Target specific projectile IDs or traits
- **Multi-tier rewards:** Progressive bonuses for milestone achievements

#### Examples Now Possible:

**Achievement: "Trigger Happy"**
- Type: ShootProjectiles
- Tiers: 1000 / 10000 / 100000 / 1000000 shots
- Rewards: Cores and eventual Loop rewards

**Achievement: "Explosive Expert"**
- Type: KillEnemies
- Filter: targetProjectileTrait = Explosive (future enhancement)
- Tiers: 100 / 1000 / 10000 kills
- Rewards: Increased explosion radius (via stat bonus system)

**Achievement: "Projectile Master"**
- Type: UnlockProjectile
- Tiers: Unlock 5 / 10 / 20 / 30 projectiles
- Rewards: Currency and special projectile unlocks

#### Benefits:
- âœ… Encourages variety in projectile usage
- âœ… Provides goals beyond "max everything"
- âœ… Adds replayability
- âœ… Integrates with daily/weekly objective system

#### Future Enhancements:
- Trait-specific kill tracking (e.g., kills with Explosive projectiles)
- Chain length achievements (hit X enemies with one Chain shot)
- Projectile mastery bonuses (permanent stat boosts for achieving milestones)

### 10. Visual Upgrade Effects

**Concept:** Projectiles visually evolve as they're upgraded

#### Features:
- **Level 1-3:** Standard appearance
- **Level 4-6:** Glowing effects
- **Level 7-10:** Particle trails, enhanced VFX
- **Mastery:** Unique cosmetic flair

#### Example:
```
Explosive Bolt
â”œâ”€â”€ Level 0: Red bolt
â”œâ”€â”€ Level 3: Red bolt with spark trail
â”œâ”€â”€ Level 5: Orange bolt with fire trail
â””â”€â”€ Level 10: Blue-white bolt with lightning trail + larger explosion
```

- **UI Complexity:** Too many options can overwhelm
- **Balance:** Power creep from too many systems

### Recommended Practices:
- Profile performance with 100+ projectiles on screen
- Compress save data (use bit flags where possible)
- Create UX mockups before implementing new UI
- Regular balance passes based on player data

## Questions for Designer/Community

Before implementing these features, consider:

1. **Complexity vs Accessibility:** How much is too much?
2. **Currency Balance:** Do we need more currency types?
3. **Player Progression Speed:** How quickly should players unlock everything?
4. **Endgame Content:** What keeps max-level players engaged?
5. **Monetization (if applicable):** Which features are premium vs free?

---

## Conclusion

The projectile system is now robust and extensible. Future enhancements should focus on:
- **Depth:** More strategic choices
- **Variety:** Diverse playstyles
- **Progression:** Long-term goals
- **Polish:** Visual/audio feedback

The foundation is solid. Build features incrementally, test with players, and iterate based on feedback.
