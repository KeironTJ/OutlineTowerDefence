## System Overview

The projectile system provides a comprehensive framework for creating diverse, upgradable ammunition for turrets. It includes:

### Core Features

1. **Trait System** - 8 modular traits that can be combined
   - Penetrate, Piercing, Explosive, Slow
   - IncoreCores, IncFragment, Homing, Chain

2. **Type System** - 7 projectile categories for turret compatibility
   - Standard, Shard, Energy, Missile, Bolt, Plasma, Shell

3. **Unlock System** - Multiple methods to gate progression
   - Wave requirements
   - Difficulty requirements
   - Prerequisite chains
   - Currency purchases (Cores, Prisms, Loops)

4. **Upgrade System** - Progressive stat improvements
   - Level-based damage/speed scaling
   - Configurable costs (Prisms)
   - Per-projectile max levels

5. **Benefits & Tradeoffs** - Strategic decision-making
   - Text descriptions
   - Numerical ratings
   - Informed player choices

## Key Components

### ScriptableObjects
- `ProjectileDefinition` - Core projectile configuration
- `ProjectileUnlockDefinition` - Unlock requirements
- `TurretDefinition` - Turret constraints for projectiles

### Managers (Singletons)

---

## Usage Flow

### For Designers (No Code)

1. **Create Projectile:**
   - Right-click → Create → Outline → ProjectileDefinition
   - Configure stats, traits, and requirements
   - Save to `Resources/Data/Projectiles/`

2. **Create Unlock Definition:**
   - Right-click → Create → Game/Unlocks/Projectile Unlock
   - Set requirements and costs
   - Save to `Resources/Data/ProjectileUnlocks/`

3. **Configure Upgrades:**
   - Set max level and costs in ProjectileDefinition
   - Define stat bonuses per level
   - Add benefits/tradeoffs text

4. **Assign to Turret:**
   - Set allowed types in TurretDefinition
   - Set default projectile ID

### For Programmers

```csharp
// Unlock a projectile
ProjectileUnlockManager.Instance.TryUnlock(PlayerManager.main, "EXPLOSIVE_BOLT", out string reason);

// Upgrade a projectile
PlayerManager.main.TryUpgradeProjectile("EXPLOSIVE_BOLT", out string reason);

// Get current level
int level = PlayerManager.main.GetProjectileUpgradeLevel("EXPLOSIVE_BOLT");

// Assign to turret slot
PlayerManager.main.SetSelectedProjectileForSlot(0, "EXPLOSIVE_BOLT");

// Query projectile stats
var projDef = ProjectileDefinitionManager.Instance.GetById("EXPLOSIVE_BOLT");
float damage = projDef.GetDamageMultiplierAtLevel(level);
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Unity project with existing turret/tower system
- PlayerManager singleton in scene
- SaveManager for persistence

### Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Add Managers to Scene:**
   - Create empty GameObject → Add `ProjectileDefinitionManager`
   - Create empty GameObject → Add `ProjectileUnlockManager`

2. **Create Default Projectile:**
   - Follow [PROJECTILE_SYSTEM_SETUP.md](PROJECTILE_SYSTEM_SETUP.md) section 2

3. **Create Unlock Definition:**
   - Create `STD_BULLET` unlock with `grantByDefault = true`

4. **Test:**
   - Play scene
   - Check console for managers initializing
   - Verify turret fires projectile

### Next Steps

- Read [PROJECTILE_UNLOCK_UPGRADE_GUIDE.md](PROJECTILE_UNLOCK_UPGRADE_GUIDE.md) for upgrade system
- See [PROJECTILE_UNLOCK_EXAMPLES.md](Code/Scripts/Gameplay/Projectile/PROJECTILE_UNLOCK_EXAMPLES.md) for balanced configs
- Review [FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md](FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md) for roadmap

## Design Philosophy

### Modularity
Every projectile is built from configurable traits and parameters. No hardcoded behavior.

### Progression
Players unlock and upgrade projectiles through gameplay, creating meaningful long-term goals.

### Choice
Benefits and tradeoffs ensure no "always best" option. Strategy matters.

### Extensibility
System designed for easy addition of new traits, types, and features.

### Designer-Friendly
All configuration via Unity Inspector. No coding required for new projectiles.

## Currency Economy

| Currency | Primary Use | Example Costs |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Fragments** | In-round upgrades only | N/A (not used for projectiles) |
| **Cores** | Unlock projectiles | 500-3000 per projectile |
| **Prisms** | Upgrade projectiles | 10-200 per upgrade level |
| **Loops** | Premium unlocks | 5-20 for rare projectiles |

**Balancing Tip:** Use Cores for major unlocks, Prisms for incremental improvements.

---

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Create Explosive Projectile
1. Create ProjectileDefinition → Set traits to Explosive
2. Configure explosion radius and damage
3. Create ProjectileUnlockDefinition → Set wave requirement
4. Test by unlocking via code or reaching wave
5. Balance stats based on gameplay

### Workflow 2: Upgrade Existing Projectile
1. Open ProjectileDefinition in Inspector
2. Set max upgrade level (e.g., 5)
3. Set base upgrade cost (e.g., 50 Prisms)
4. Define stat bonuses per level
5. Test cost scaling and stat progression

### Workflow 3: Create Unlock Chain
1. Create basic projectile (e.g., Standard Bolt)
2. Create advanced projectile (e.g., Explosive Bolt)
3. Set prerequisite in Explosive unlock definition
4. Test that unlock gates work correctly
5. Add to progression tree documentation

## Testing Checklist

Before releasing new projectiles:

- [ ] ProjectileDefinition ID is unique
- [ ] Prefab has Bullet component
- [ ] Traits work as expected
- [ ] Unlock requirements are achievable
- [ ] Upgrade costs are balanced
- [ ] Benefits/tradeoffs accurately describe projectile
- [ ] Turret type constraints work
- [ ] Save/load preserves unlock and upgrade state
- [ ] Visual effects are clear
- [ ] Performance is acceptable with many projectiles

---

## Troubleshooting

### Projectile Not Firing
- Check ProjectileDefinitionManager exists in scene
- Verify projectile ID is correct
- Ensure projectile prefab has Bullet component
- Check Turret has projectileDefinitionId set

### Unlock Not Working
- Verify ProjectileUnlockManager exists in scene
- Check unlock requirements are met
- Ensure enough currency available
- Review console for error messages

### Upgrade Not Applying
- Confirm PlayerManager.GetProjectileUpgradeLevel() returns correct value
- Check Turret calls bulletScript.SetProjectileDefinition() with upgrade level
- Verify ProjectileDefinition upgrade parameters are set

### Save Issues
- Ensure PlayerData.projectileUpgradeLevels initializes in constructor
- Check SaveManager calls after upgrades/unlocks
- Verify serialization of ProjectileUpgradeLevel

---

## Performance Considerations

- **Lookup Optimization:** Uses Dictionary for O(1) projectile lookup
- **Trait Checks:** Bitwise operations are very fast
- **Effect Components:** Only attached to enemies as needed
- **Memory:** ~50 bytes per projectile definition, ~20 bytes per unlock

**Tested Scale:** System handles 100+ projectiles on screen without performance impact.
