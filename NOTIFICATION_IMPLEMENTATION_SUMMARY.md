## Integration Points

### Existing Event Listeners
The system automatically integrates with:
- `AchievementTierCompleted` event
- `ChipUnlocked` event
- `SkillUnlocked` event

### Manual Triggers
Systems that manually trigger notifications:
- DailyObjectiveManager (completion/claim)
- WeeklyObjectiveManager (completion/claim)
- AchievementManager (tier claim)

### Future Integration Points
Ready for:
- Store pack openings
- Research completions
- Social features
- Limited-time events

## Usage Examples

### Simple Quick Notification
```csharp
NotificationManager.Instance.ShowQuickNotification(
    "Wave Complete!", 
    "You survived wave 10!", 
    NotificationSource.System
);
```

### Modal with Rewards
```csharp
var rewards = new NotificationReward[]
{
    new NotificationReward(NotificationRewardType.Currency, "", 100, CurrencyType.Prisms)
};

NotificationManager.Instance.ShowModalNotification(
    "Achievement Unlocked!",
    "Speed Demon achievement earned!",
    rewards,
    NotificationSource.Achievement,
    "speed_demon"
);
```

### Adding Indicator to Button
```csharp
// Add component to any button
var helper = achievementsButton.AddComponent<NotificationButtonHelper>();
// Badge is auto-created and configured
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Quick Notifications**
   - Trigger various game events (wave complete, enemy killed, etc.)
   - Verify animations and timing
   - Check that multiple notifications queue properly

2. **Modal Notifications**
   - Claim achievement rewards
   - Complete objectives with manual claim
   - Verify reward granting
   - Test close/claim buttons

3. **Visual Indicators**
   - Complete objectives and check button badges
   - Unlock achievements and verify indicators
   - Test count display (single digit and 9+)
   - Verify pulsing animation

4. **Integration**
   - Test with existing achievement system
   - Test with daily/weekly objectives
   - Verify chip unlock notifications
   - Check skill unlock notifications

## Performance Considerations

- Queue prevents notification spam
- Max queue size configurable
- Quick notifications auto-dismiss
- Modal notifications pause queue
- Minimal memory footprint
- Event-driven updates (no polling)

## Known Limitations and Future Work

### Current Limitations
- No notification history panel (could be added)
- No sound effects (easily added via events)
- No notification persistence across sessions
- Icons use generic mapping (can be enhanced with sprite database)

### Future Enhancements
- Notification history/archive panel
- Sound effects for different notification types
- Priority-based display ordering
- Rich text formatting support
- Notification persistence
- Push notification support (mobile)
- Notification categories and filtering
- Custom notification templates
- Localization support
