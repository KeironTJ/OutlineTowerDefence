## What Needs UI Setup (In Unity Editor)

⚠️ **UI Prefabs Required:**

The following UI elements need to be created in Unity:

1. **ChipSelectionPanel**
   - Container for ChipSelectorUI component
   - Reference in LoadoutScreen

2. **ChipButtonPrefab**
   - Template for chip list items
   - Children: ChipName (TMP), Icon (Image), Rarity (TMP), LockedPanel, EquippedIndicator

3. **ChipSlotPrefab**
   - Template for equipment slots
   - Children: ChipName (TMP), Icon (Image), LockedPanel, EmptyPanel

4. **ChipDetailsPanel**
   - Detailed chip information display
   - Children: Multiple TMP/Image components (see ChipSelectorUI)

5. **Buttons**
   - Purchase button
   - Unlock slot button
   - Equip/Unequip buttons
   - Close button

## Unity Scene Setup

1. **Create ChipService GameObject**
   ```
   - Add ChipService component
   - Assign chip definitions to loadedDefinitions array
   - Make it persistent (DontDestroyOnLoad)
   ```

2. **Update LoadoutScreen**
   ```
   - Add chipSelectionPanel reference
   - Add openChipSelectorButton reference
   - Connect button onClick to open chips
   ```

3. **Optional: Add ChipDebugger**
   ```
   - Create GameObject in scene
   - Add ChipDebugger component
   - Configure test parameters
   ```

## Testing Workflow

### Initial Setup
1. Open Unity Editor
2. Run menu: `Outline > Create Example Chips`
3. Find ChipService in scene hierarchy
4. Add example chips to loadedDefinitions array
5. Press Play

### In Play Mode
1. Use ChipDebugger hotkeys:
   - `P` = Add Prisms
   - `U` = Unlock Slot
   - `B` = Buy Chip
   - `H` = Toggle Debug UI

2. Or use UI:
   - Open Loadout screen
   - Click "Chips" button
   - Purchase and equip chips

3. Start a round to see bonuses applied

## Extension Points

### Adding New Bonus Types

1. Add to ChipBonusType enum:
```csharp
public enum ChipBonusType
{
    // ... existing types
    MyNewBonus
}
```

2. Implement in RoundManager.ApplyChipBonuses():
```csharp
case ChipBonusType.MyNewBonus:
    // Apply your bonus logic
    break;
```

### Integration with Other Systems

**Achievements:**
- Use ChipAchievementRewards.cs as template
- Reward chips on achievement completion

**Daily Objectives:**
- Grant chips as objective rewards
- Add chips to reward pools

**Shop System:**
- Offer chip packs for purchase
- Create special limited chips

**Season Pass:**
- Include chips in season rewards
- Exclusive seasonal chips

## Known Limitations

1. **UI Prefabs Not Included**
   - Requires Unity Editor setup
   - No prefab files in code commit

2. **Bonus Application**
   - Only FragmentsBoost fully implemented
   - Other bonuses need skill system integration

3. **Visual Assets**
   - No chip icons included
   - Needs art assets

4. **Localization**
   - Text not localized
   - Hardcoded English strings

## Future Enhancement Ideas

1. **Chip Sets**
   - Bonus for equipping related chips
   - Set completion tracking

2. **Chip Fusion**
   - Combine chips for variants
   - Special fusion recipes

3. **Chip Trading**
   - Player-to-player trading
   - Market system

4. **Temporary Chips**
   - Time-limited powerful chips
   - Special event chips

5. **Chip Challenges**
   - Objectives for specific chips
   - Unlock special abilities

6. **Advanced Stats**
   - Usage tracking
   - Popular chip analytics

## Code Quality Notes

- **Modularity**: System is self-contained
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new bonus types
- **Maintainability**: Well-documented and commented
- **Testing**: Debug tools included
- **Compatibility**: Backwards compatible with existing saves
- **Performance**: Efficient bonus calculation
- **Architecture**: Follows existing code patterns

## Credits
